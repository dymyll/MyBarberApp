# My Barber App

- The goal is to have a user find a barber that is in their city.
- The barbers that are within the database will show up including their corresponding Barbershop that they work in, if they meet the city search requirements.
- If the user clicks the barber, the user will be redirected to the reviews page, which uses a yelp api service, for that particular barbershop
